How to build
==================

Prerequisites
-------------

1. Download and install Ruby 1.8.7+ from http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads
2. At the command prompt run the following to update RubyGems to the latest version: 

	gem update --system

3. You will need the albacore gem, install this at the command prompt with:

	gem install albacore

If you have already installed albacore, please update to the lastest version (0.2.2+):

	gem update albacore


Building
--------------

1. At the command prompt, navigate to the root folder (should contain rakefile.rb) of the project
2. To run the default build (which will compile, test and package Rosanna) type the following command:

	rake

In addition, you can see the full list of all the build tasks by running:

	rake -T

To run a particular task ('test' for example), use the following command:

	rake test

After the build has completed, there will be a new folder in the root called "build". It contains the following folders:

* binaries -> All the Rosanna assembilies and their dependencies
* nuget -> The Rosanna[version].nupkg (TODO)
